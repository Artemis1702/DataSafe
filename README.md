# Data Safe

The focus of this project is to develop a data management system using C language which can store data (.txt) in an encrypted format so that it is safe and can be retrieved by the user when and if necessary.

## Abstract

The idea for this project (Package) is to develop a code in C language which is capable of accepting and storing data. The differentiating idea is to implement encoding algorithms to replace the inputted data and store it in an encoded form. The actual data can be only retrieved if the user is able to re-enter the password he provided while storing the data.\
The code developed will allocate a directory for a specific user and accept a password using which the user will be able to enter data which gets encoded and stored inside the directory created. The original data will be deleted and the encoded format will become the only form of the data present. The original data can be obtained by decoding the encoded data using the decoding algorithm if the user is able to present the password.
